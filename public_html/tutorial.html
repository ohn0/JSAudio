        <h1>Audio Player Tutorial</h1>
        <div id="overview">
        This is an audio player framework that lets the user insert music files
        and play them on their site. At the minimum, the user needs to supply a 
        div element and a mp3/ogg file into the framework to get the music player.
        The user can choose whether or not they want to include visualizations.
        <br/>
        I wanted to build an audio player and I managed to do that using the audio
        API provided. I also wanted to create some visualizations to go along with
        the music being played and was able to create three types of visuals: a bar,
        line, and circle visual, creative names, right?<br/>
        This tutorial will allow the reader to get familiar with the audio API and
        learn how to extract data from the audio file and use it in canvas.
